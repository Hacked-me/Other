## How to get a full physical dump from Minix Neo X7 ##
(The RK3188 features a quad-core ARM Cortex-A9) and Android 4.2 â€“ 4.4)


The utility [RKdumper](https://forum.xda-developers.com/general/rooting-roms/tool-rkdumper-utility-backup-firmware-t2915363) 
(see [.log](https://github.com/kacos2000/Other/blob/master/Minix/rkdumper.log) with output from a test) Dump of only the system and user partitions).<br> 

Use the driver set from Rockchip [Source #1](https://github.com/chirimen-oh/CHIRIMEN-tools) or [Source #2](https://androidmtk.com/download-rockchip-driver-assistant), 
to get a dump of all the partitions.

For RKdumper to work, you need a Windows cmd terminal with admin privileges, 
and you also need to put the RockChip device in recovery(firmware flash) mode 
(press the recessed recover button and keep pressing while powering device on until seen by the PC). 

No need to connect device to display. Just the mini-usb cable attached to PC and power.
